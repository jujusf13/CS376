Describe what you did, how you did it, what challenges you encountered, and how you solved them.
- I wrote a Bash script to monitor and alert increases in CPU usage. I did the assignment by following along the code provided within the instructions of the assignment. I didn't encounter any challenges because the instructions were clear, but the syntax is a new and confusing to me.

If collaboration with a buddy was permitted, did you work with a buddy on this assignment? If so, who? If not, do you certify that this submission represents your own original work?
- This submission would not be my own work really because it was all in the instructions. I think the purpose was to just get our feet wet with some programming in the terminal.

Please identify any and all portions of your submission that were not originally written by you (for example, code originally written by your buddy, or anything taken or adapted from a non-classroom resource). It is always OK to use your textbook and instructor notes; however, you are certifying that any portions not designated as coming from an outside person or source are your own original work.
- None of the work was mine.

Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)?
- About 45 minutes

Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
- It was something very different than I am used to. It's uncomfortable working with all of these characters especially when I am becoming more accustomed to the colorful highlighted variables in VSCode

Using the grading specifications on this page, discuss briefly the grade you would give yourself and why. Discuss each item in the grading specification.
- An A. I followed all the instructions and got a working programming.
